================================================================================
PART 4: QUICK REFERENCE RULES
================================================================================

CONCEPTUAL BOUNDARIES:
  - Break script at natural thought boundaries
  - If a line takes >3 seconds to say, it likely needs multiple clips
  - Each clip should have ONE visual focus
  - Change clip when: topic shifts, emotion shifts, or emphasis needed

MATCHING RULES:
  - Mention product by name -> PRODUCT SHOT
  - Show how it works -> SCREEN DEMO or DEMONSTRATION
  - Direct address ('you', 'your') -> TALKING HEAD
  - Stats or key points -> TEXT GRAPHIC
  - Emotional/aspirational language -> LIFESTYLE or BROLL
  - Customer quote or result -> TESTIMONIAL
  - Action words (click, sign up, get) -> CTA with TEXT GRAPHIC

PACING:
  - Don't stay on talking head too long - cut to broll/product
  - After product shot, often return to talking head
  - Text graphics are punchy - use for emphasis, not narration
  - Broll covers transitions and adds visual variety
