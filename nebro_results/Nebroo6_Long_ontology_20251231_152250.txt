It took us 3000 years to understand how our hearing actually works. The biggest myth about hearing loss is when people say that hearing loss is a volume problem. There's one simple hearing loss hack that Americans over 60 can do to hear clearly as if they were in their 20s. For a very long time, since Ancient Greece, we've known about this tiny bone in our ear called the cochlea. It's about a quarter of an inch in width that's about the width of a pencil, and it's sealed, it's spiral shaped and it's made of hollow bone and full of a special fluid. The first anatomical drawings of it appeared in the 16th century, I think. in the 16th century, I think. As Italian anatomists started to really study the body in detail. However it wasn't until 1851 that another Italian guy called Alfonso Corti, a scientist, really learnt what was inside the cochlea. He opened it up and he discovered a part inside, that's now called the Organ of Corti, named after him. And most importantly, he identified that it was covered in these very tiny filaments that looked like hairs. We now know these as hair cells and we call the filaments on top stereocilia. And we know that sound enters the ear canal, passes through the eardrum and a series of tiny bones. The last bone pushes on the cochlea The last bone pushes on the cochlea and creates waves in the fluid inside it. And as the waves flow around the spiral, they cause the stereocilia to bend, like seaweed in the current. Another guy, Georg von Békésy, won a Noble Prize in I think 1961 for showing how sound traveled through the Organ of Corti and he showed that the stereocilia played a part in this and how they bent as the sound waves passed. But we still didn't understand what they actually did. It wasn't until the early 80s that our microscopes became good enough and we realized that when these tiny stereocilia bent, it was opening tiny holes, or gates, as we call them it was opening tiny holes, or gates, as we call them that allow specific molecules to enter. These molecules had an electric charge and the chargers created tiny electric signals that were sent to the brain. Now we understood the stereocilia were the way our bodies converted the physical movements of sound waves into electrical impulses, to pass the information from our ears to our brain. But it basically took until the 21st century that we finally saw why so many people develop hearing loss with age. The problem with the stereocilia and the hair cells that they are part of, is that when they break, from regular wear and tear or because a very loud noise made them bend too far, they don't regrow. There is some genetic flaw that stops them from repairing and the cell often dies. And this happens all throughout your adult life. You have a limited number of stereocilia and you just lose them little by little as you get older, leading to hearing loss. And what's even more interesting is that, Different hair cells detect different frequencies. So, high frequencies are picked up near the cochlea's opening, while lower frequencies are sensed further inside. And this is how the brain understands speech. Each word is made up of small sounds like the “c,” “a,” “t” sounds in “cat.” When each When each sound enters your cochlea, the hair cells send signals if they detect a matching frequency. These signals travel to your brain, which assembles them into words. Instead, your brain is wired to process speech very quickly. It doesn't need to analyze each sound separately. Instead, it recognizes words instantly by connecting sound signals to word 'templates' stored in your memory. For example, your brain has a template for the word 'cat'. When it hears the 'c,' 'a,' 't' sounds in order, it recognizes the word instantly and adds the meaning of cat and other ideas you associate with it like... like "cute," or "kitten," or "pet." So when you have Hearing loss, it disrupts two important systems: your ear's ability to pick up sounds clearly and your brain's ability to recognize words automatically. And This is why people often lose high-frequency hearing first. The hair cells that detect these sounds are closest to where the sound enters and take the most damage, and then the sound waves get weaker and weaker as they travel around the cochlea. that's why the low frequency hair cells at the center of the cochlea are better protected. As the hair cells break, your brain receives less information, especially for high frequencies. This explains why it's usually harder to hear the 't' or 's' sounds in words. These sounds are in higher frequencies, which are the first to fade with hearing loss. So, what problem does this cause in your brain? Your brain needs all the sounds in a word to recognize it instantly. But if your ear doesn't detect a sound, like the 't' in 'cat', then the brain can't recognize the word as easily. You might hear most of the sounds, but now your brain has to work harder to guess the missing ones, which is exhausting. So, instead of understanding words easily, your brain has to focus and try to 'fill in the gaps.' This extra work conversations confusing, tiring and frustrating. Even if people speak louder, you're still missing certain sounds. So it's not a volume issue - it's a frequency problem. To understand words instantly, your brain needs to hear all the sounds. With hearing loss, you lose that automatic recognition, and understanding speech takes a lot more effort. So what can we do about it? Well, for the past 25 years, Americans with hearing loss have been faced with one really bad choice, until one company started looking at the problem in a completely different way. Here's what normally happens. As you enter your 60s and 70s, As you enter your 60s and 70s, most people notice that they can't hear as well as they used to. And it's starting to cause them problems with their daily life. And one of the very frustrating things is that even though people feel like they haven't lost that much hearing, they still feel like conversations are much harder. They don't understand people easily, even though it seems like they can hear most of what's being said. In fact, in the first few years of hearing loss, the most common reaction is just to blame other people, I'm sure a lot of you have done this. Like 'people don't speak clearly anymore' or 'my wife started mumbling'. This reaction is common because it's hard to really tell exactly how good or bad your own hearing is, exactly how good or bad your own hearing is, because the change is so slow. I also think TV and Movies are a little bit to blame here too because all the people we see on the screen with hearing loss are basically deaf, they can't hear anything even when you scream at them. In the real world, the majority of people only have moderate hearing loss. It's not as bad as you see on TV and in the Movies. But soon it's impossible to ignore the impact your hearing loss is having on your life. Families get annoyed because they have to keep repeating themselves to you. Your friends notice that they see you less and less because you start avoiding social events as you feel embarrassed about your hearing. Even simple activities like running to the store or grabbing a coffee become stressful as you worry you won't understand what people say to you. So, after a few years, when it's clear that you have a problem, you have to face this one bad choice. Option 1. Do nothing. You keep struggling through every conversation, you start losing part of your relationships and friendships because the communication is worse and worse, and you feel more stressed, more lonely and isolated. Option 2. Go to a doctor, get a prescription and pay thousands of dollars for a prescription hearing aid. That's it. That's really the only choice people have had for decades. And a lot of people simply cannot take option 2. And a lot of people simply cannot take option 2. They don't have that kind of money and it's very very difficult in America to get any kind of private or public medical insurance that will pay these costs. This is why there are around 20 million Americans living with untreated hearing loss today. And this is unacceptable. Hearing loss is not some small inconvenience. it's a huge problem that affects your whole life and even moderate hearing loss can create a big communication problem. I'm going to explain why in just a second because it's actually one of the biggest misunderstandings about hearing loss. People say 'my hearing isn't that bad' and they think that means they don't need any help. and they think that means they don't need any help. But they are wrong. Even when you just have moderate hearing loss. there is a reason why it still causes you a lot of problems. So let me hop on my computer and show you something. Now, I've simplified this a lot but basically this is a map of normal human hearing. Down here we have low frequency and low volume, like a truck rumbling in the distance. And up here we have high frequency and high volume, like a plane screaming past overhead, almost deafening you. And this area is the range of human speech, with different letters at different frequencies. Because speech is what we really care about, that's the thing that's making your life much more difficult. So here's what happens when you have moderate hearing loss. You don't lose too much volume but you can see that you lose more at the higher frequencies and that cuts out things like bird song and some letters from normal human speech. Every word we say is made up of all these letter sounds and some of the letters like F and S, are higher frequency than others like vowels O and A. O, A. You can hear the difference. But losing some letters is actually a big problem. Your brain has spent your whole life learning to immediately identify words and now, some of that vital information is gone. So letters get mixed up and you're not sure where some words begin and end. It's like your language navigation has a bug, It's like your language navigation has a bug, and now you have to work really hard to concentrate and think to try to work out what people are saying. Before hearing loss, you did it without thinking. But now, it's tiring and confusing. Even though you can see here that you still hear most of what people are saying. Let's look at one final stage; this is what severe hearing loss looks like. So you can see that now most of human speech is gone. You can hear a few sounds here and there but you're missing most of what people are saying. Now, this brings us all the way back to that one bad choice that the millions of Americans with hearing loss have to make. Do nothing or spend thousands on a prescription hearing aid. But here's why it's such a bad choice. It's such a bad choice. Those prescription hearing aids that cost an average of $4,500 are designed to fix this problem. They're designed to help people with severe hearing loss, who've lost most of the sounds of human speech. To put it simply, you have to pay thousands of dollars to solve this problem. But you only have this problem. so what if someone designed a hearing aid to only fix this? A hearing aid exclusively designed for moderate hearing loss that helped people get back the full range of human speech so they could hear people clearly and without needing to strain and concentrate. But also made without all of the expensive components and features that are required to help those with severe hearing loss. Because even though this difference doesn't look like much. Let me tell you, when it comes to engineering and programming a hearing aid, it's a very big difference. And it's the key reason why prescription hearing aids are so expensive. The main issue is to do with feedback. Because you have to boost the volume to such high levels, this means that the sound the hearing aid sends to your ear is also picked up by the microphone so it creates a feedback loop that leads to chirping and whistling and would make your hearing aid impossible to use. So, they need to add in very specific microphones and amplifiers, as well as creating algorithms that remove the feedback, so that people can hear easily. This adds so much cost to the development, the testing and the manufacturing so that's why prescription hearing aids come with these huge price tags of 4 thousand, 6 thousand, even 10 thousand dollars. That's why our company, Nebroo, decided to look at this problem completely differently. 75% of people with hearing loss only have it at a moderate level. So there needs to be a device that works just for their problem, without the huge volume problem and cost that come with severe hearing loss. Because the number one reason why people don't get the help they need is cost. So we got to work. We focused on making a device that produced the highest and most natural sound quality possible, quality possible, for the lowest price we could. It needed to boost the range of human speech, especially to boost the higher frequency ranges that caused people the most problems. It also needed to cut out background noise to help people focus on just the most important thing: human speech. And on top of this, we wanted to encourage as many people as possible to use it by removing one other big excuse: size. People don't want to be seen wearing a hearing aid. It makes them feel old and embarrassed and even though I wish that wasn't the case, I wish people didn't care and just got the help they needed... well, they do care and I totally understand that. So we cut the size down as much as we could so it would sit easily in people's ear canal, so it would sit easily in people's ear canal, almost invisible to everyone around them, while still having enough battery power to last all day. And I'm happy to say that we did it. The Nebroo Pro was a big success and it helped 100,000 people to finally afford the help they needed and start hearing clearly again. Our customers said it was easy to use, super comfortable and one of the best value products they'd ever seen. But, it still wasn't perfect. We knew we had got the price right. We had seen how relieved people were that they could get the help they needed without seeing a doctor or spending thousands of dollars. But as we talked to customers and got even more real world data from Nebroo being used all across the country, we knew we could do even better with the sound and make it easier to use, in any way we could. So here is what we improved. First, because the most important sounds most people miss are the higher frequencies of regular human speech, we found a way to split the frequencies into smaller ranges, which allowed us more control over how we boosted them. This meant we could boost the higher frequencies of speech more, while keeping the middle and lower frequencies more balanced, so you got every range at the ideal volume. On top of this, because we could break the sound up into more accurate frequency ranges, this also allowed us to remove any whistling completely and it even helped remove more background noise. and it even helped remove more background noise. Next we focused on usability. In our first Nebroo Pro, you could adjust the volume of each device with a small tool. Most people only needed to do this once but we always wished this first step was easier. So for our new product, everything is controlled with a simple button that allows you to set 6 different volume levels and the Nebroo also turn on automatically when you put them in your ear. And finally, we even managed to make them smaller than before to increase comfort and make them even more discreet. We are absolutely delighted to release the Nebroo Pro 2.0 to the public, with all of these new upgrades included. And here’s the really good news for you today. Even though these upgrades have pushed the full retail price of the Nebroo Pro have pushed the full retail price of the Nebroo Pro from $200 to $330 for the Nebroo 2.0, we have a limited time offer to help spread the word about this new version.

And I recommend it to actually about four friends and all of them told me that they were gonna get it because I told them how happy and satisfied I was. Nice! Thank you for the great product that you make. Well I followed the directions, you know, 2 hours a day for week 1 and that really helped because it was such a good product. To be able to hear was almost annoying for a while. and then I was able to... wear it all the time. and that was great! Once I got it in and I got it in the right level I forgot it was in there. It didn't bother me, I didn't have to readjust it, it was great! I mean that just that actually surprised me because hearing aids that I've had before I would have to redo them or pull on the ear to make it fit and different things. I didn't with that, you know, it was great! clean it up, make it a little clearer. If I can tell you that the main things that I, that I liked about the hearing aid was it was comfortable to wear. Once I got it in and I got a good, I call it 'seal', no problems. It was very easy once I learned once I learned how to reach up and touch the button, so I mean, I was very impressed with your product.
