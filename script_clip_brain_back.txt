## SECTION 1: SHOT TYPE TAXONOMY

### A) PROTAGONIST/HERO SHOTS
Shots featuring the primary narrator, expert, or user avatar.

*   **The Authority Anchor:** Medium shot, eye-level, direct address. Used to establish trust or deliver a "warning."
    *   *Example:* The repair technician in his home office explaining planned obsolescence (MagVolt Pro).
    *   *Example:* Master Chen in his studio explaining the hand-brain connection (NeuroSpin).
*   **The Candid Expert:** Medium or wide shot, subject performing a relevant task, not looking at the camera. Establishes competence.
    *   *Example:* The technician looking through a microscope or soldering a chip.
    *   *Example:* Master Chen leading a Tai Chi class.
*   **The Relatable User:** Medium shot, often outdoors or in a home setting, looking at the camera or slightly off-axis. Used for testimonials.
    *   *Example:* The "Cowboy Narrator" sitting against a brick wall sharing his skepticism (Air Purifier).
*   **The Struggle Avatar:** Close-ups or medium shots of a person failing at a task due to the problem the product solves. Often B&W or low-key lighting.
    *   *Example:* Elderly woman unable to stand up from a chair (Smart Cane).
    *   *Example:* Woman holding her head in pain from sinus pressure (Air Purifier).

### B) PRODUCT/SUBJECT SHOTS
Shots focused exclusively on the item being sold.

*   **The "Hero" Reveal:** High-key lighting, clean background (often white or neon), slow pan or static. Introduces the solution.
    *   *Example:* The Smart Cane unfolding against neon lines.
    *   *Example:* The MagAir device isolated on a clean white wall.
*   **The "Magic" Demo:** Close-up showing the mechanism of action, often accelerated or stylized.
    *   *Example:* Smoke clearing instantly in a test chamber (Air Purifier).
    *   *Example:* Battery percentage jumping from 4% to 12% rapidly (MagVolt Pro).
*   **The Durability/Build Shot:** Extreme close-up (macro) of materials to imply quality.
    *   *Example:* Carbon fiber texture on the cane.
    *   *Example:* Internal circuit board components (MagVolt Pro).
*   **The Lifestyle Integration:** Wide or medium shot showing the product naturally placed in a beautiful home environment.
    *   *Example:* The air purifier plugged in next to a vase of flowers in a clean living room.

### C) B-ROLL CATEGORIES
Supplementary footage used to visualize concepts.

*   **Visceral Agitation (The Enemy):** High-impact, often gross or scary visuals representing the problem.
    *   *Example:* Black mold growing in a corner (Air Purifier).
    *   *Example:* A shattered phone screen or swollen battery (MagVolt Pro).
    *   *Example:* An elderly person falling on the grass (Smart Cane).
*   **Institutional/Conspiracy:** Imagery representing "The System," "Regulators," or "Big Corps."
    *   *Example:* SWAT teams, courtrooms, corporate boardrooms, factory assembly lines.
*   **Metaphorical Visuals:** Abstract clips representing a concept.
    *   *Example:* A ticking stopwatch (Urgency/Time running out).
    *   *Example:* Empty warehouse shelves (Scarcity).
    *   *Example:* A child running away (Memory loss).
*   **Scientific Validation:** Lab settings, microscopes, or technical schematics.
    *   *Example:* Engineer in a clean suit working on a rover (NASA connection).

### D) TEXT/GRAPHIC SHOTS
*   **The Headline Card:** Bold text on a solid or high-contrast background. Used for the Hook.
    *   *Example:* "The government is banning this..."
*   **The "Kill Switch" Overlay:** Red "X" or "Sold Out" graphics superimposed over competitor products or standard settings.
    *   *Example:* Red X over a standard walker.
*   **The Scientific HUD:** Digital overlays (circles, grids, data streams) on top of product shots to imply advanced tech.
    *   *Example:* Green scanning grid over the Smart Cane base.

### E) SCREEN RECORDINGS/DEMOS
*   **The "Proof" Interface:** Recording of a screen showing a metric improving.
    *   *Example:* Battery health graph going up.
*   **The "Failure" Interface:** Recording of a screen showing a warning or error.
    *   *Example:* "Low Battery" red icon or "Storage Full" notification.

## SECTION 2: CONCEPTUAL BOUNDARIES
*Where to cut and why.*

### A) SCRIPT-DRIVEN BOUNDARIES
*   **The Noun Rule:** When a new physical object or entity is named, the visual **must** change to match it immediately.
    *   *Script:* "Regulators..." -> *Visual:* Courtroom/Gavel.
    *   *Script:* "...will force the company..." -> *Visual:* Factory exterior.
    *   *Script:* "...to neuter its design." -> *Visual:* Inferior/broken product.
*   **The List Rule:** If the script lists items, cut on every item.
    *   *Script:* "Basements [CUT], bathrooms [CUT], bedrooms [CUT]."

### B) EMOTIONAL BOUNDARIES
*   **The Pivot Point:** The exact moment the script shifts from "Problem" to "Solution" requires a drastic visual shift (Lighting, Color, Motion).
    *   *Data Pattern:* Struggle shots are often B&W/Muted/Shaky. Solution shots are Color/Bright/Stable.
    *   *Example:* "But now civilians finally have access..." -> Cut from dark military scene to bright sunny porch with happy seniors.

### C) STRUCTURAL BOUNDARIES
*   **The "Bad News" Drop:** Transitioning from the Hook to the Agitation often involves a "Pivot" graphic or sound effect.
    *   *Example:* "But here's the bad news" -> Visual of a warning sign or sudden dark shift.
*   **The Scarcity Injection:** Transitioning to the CTA usually involves a location shift to a warehouse or empty shelf.

### D) PACING BOUNDARIES
*   **Agitation Speed:** During problem description, cuts should be rapid (0.5s - 1.5s) to create anxiety.
*   **Demo Stability:** During product demonstration, shots should be longer (2.0s - 4.0s) to allow the viewer to understand the mechanics and feel distinct relief.

## SECTION 3: PROTAGONIST/HERO USAGE PATTERNS

### A) WHEN TO SHOW THE PROTAGONIST
*   **The Setup (0:00-0:10):** Establish the persona immediately to ground the voiceover.
    *   *Example:* "22 years as a repair engineer..." -> Show the engineer in his workspace.
*   **The "Truth" Reveal:** When delivering the conspiracy or the "secret," show the face to build connection.
    *   *Example:* "I don't know why other shops aren't talking about this."
*   **The Personal Endorsement:** When saying "I use this" or "I bought this for my family."

### B) WHEN TO CUT AWAY FROM PROTAGONIST
*   **Visualization of Claims:** Never let the protagonist just *talk* about a problem. Cut away immediately to B-roll of the problem.
    *   *Rule:* If the protagonist says "mold," cut to mold. Do not stay on the talking head saying the word "mold."
*   **Technical Explanation:** When explaining *how* it works, cut to animations or demos.

### C) PROTAGONIST SHOT VARIATIONS
*   **The "Whistleblower" Angle:** Slightly low angle or close-up, looking slightly off-camera or directly at the lens. Implies they are telling you something confidential.
*   **The "Competence" Angle:** Wide or medium shot of them working with their hands (fixing a phone, teaching a class). Proves they aren't just an actor.

## SECTION 5: TRANSITION PATTERNS

### A) COMMON SEQUENCES
1.  **The "Contrast Cut":**
    *   *Sequence:* [B&W Struggle/Pain] → [Hard Cut] → [Bright Color Satisfaction/Relief].
    *   *Why:* Visually reinforces the "Before/After" without needing a split screen.
2.  **The "Zoom into Truth":**
    *   *Sequence:* [Wide shot of device] → [Zoom/Macro into internal components] → [Animation of tech working].
    *   *Why:* Takes the viewer from the physical object to the invisible value proposition.
3.  **The "Authority Bridge":**
    *   *Sequence:* [Talking Head Expert] → [B-roll of Expert Working] → [Talking Head Expert].
    *   *Why:* Validates the speaker's credentials visually before allowing them to speak again.

### B) AWKWARD TRANSITIONS TO AVOID
*   **Static to Static:** Avoid cutting from a static product shot to a static landscape. Use movement (pan/zoom) to bridge them.
*   **Tone Clash:** Do not cut from a "High Energy/Scarcity" clip (SWAT team) directly to a "Low Energy/Calm" clip (Sleeping baby) without a bridging line or sound effect.

## SECTION 6: VERTICAL-AGNOSTIC PRINCIPLES

1.  **Visual Hyperbole:**
    *   Do not just show the literal meaning. Show the *emotional* or *exaggerated* meaning.
    *   *Rule:* If the script says "regulators are stopping this," don't show a man signing paper. Show a SWAT team or a gavel slamming.
    *   *Rule:* If the script says "mold is bad," show a wall *covered* in black slime, not just a speck.

2.  **The "Invisible made Visible" Principle:**
    *   If the product's mechanism is invisible (air purification, stability, battery charging), you **must** use animation or overlays to make it visible.
    *   *Rule:* Never rely on voiceover alone to explain a technical feature. Use glowing lines, particles, or HUDs.

3.  **Pacing by Emotion:**
    *   **Fear/Agitation Phase:** Fast cuts, chaotic motion, handheld camera, darker lighting.
    *   **Solution/Benefit Phase:** Stable camera (tripod/gimbal), bright lighting, slower cuts, clear focus.

4.  **Visual Verification:**
    *   Every specific claim requires specific visual proof.
    *   *Rule:* If you say "4 times longer," show a timer. If you say "3,000 phones," show a pile of 3,000 phones.

5.  **The "Us vs. Them" Visual Language:**
    *   Visuals should clearly distinguish between the "Hero" (the product/creator) and the "Villain" (Big Pharma, Big Tech, The Government).
    *   *Villain Visuals:* Cold, industrial, dark, faceless suits, red X's.
    *   *Hero Visuals:* Warm, domestic, bright, human faces, green checks.
