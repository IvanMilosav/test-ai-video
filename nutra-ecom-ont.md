# The Direct Response "Neutra-Ecom" Creative Playbook

## I. Core Philosophy

> *"We do not innovate on structure; we innovate within the structure."*

The script provides the narrative, but the **Concept Unit** provides the retention. In the current ad landscape (post-Andromeda), the battleground is purely visual. We must fight to hold the viewer's attention on a sentence-by-sentence basis.

**The Retention Rule:** If a viewer feels bored for a single sentence, they scroll.

**The Creative Meta:** First-mover advantage is superseded by superior creative. A better visual execution of the same script will steal the auction.

**The "Slop" Filter:** Every clip matters. Generic stock footage is "slop." We use AI to generate hyper-specific, narrative-driven visuals.

## II. The Ontology: Defining the Units

To break a script down effectively, stop reading sentences and start seeing **Concept Units**.

### 1. The Concept Unit (The Atom)

**Definition:** The smallest indivisible unit of visual storytelling.

**Duration:** Strict 2–3 seconds max.

**The Golden Rule:** One Concept Unit = One distinct visual idea.

**Constraint:** Never span a single clip across two distinct concepts (e.g., "The Problem" and "The Solution" must always be separate clips).

### 2. The Visual Taxonomy (The Buckets)

Every Concept Unit falls into one of these six buckets. Identify the bucket before writing the prompt.

| Bucket | Purpose | Visual Signature | AI Prompt Keywords |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **The Agitation** | Visually demonstrate the visceral struggle/pain. | Trembling, fumbling, dropping, dark lighting, frustration, isolation. | Hyper-realistic, close-up, struggle, trembling, cinematic gloom, clumsy. |
| **The UMP** | Explain the "Unique Mechanism of the Problem." | "Sciency" footage. Glowing nerves, dimming lights, disconnecting wires, biological animation. | Medical animation, high-fidelity, glowing neural pathways, sci-fi aesthetic, translucent skin. |
| **The Hero** | Relatability. The viewer sees themselves in the avatar. | Daily life, close-ups of faces, hands performing tasks, authentic home settings. | Cinematic, authentic, 60s/70s, relatable, candid, detailed texture. |
| **The Authority** | Establish trust and credibility. | "Master Chen," Doctors, White coats, Dojos, Stern/Wise expressions. | Wise, authoritative, serious, cinematic portrait, depth of field. |
| **The Paradise** | The "After" state. The emotional payoff. | Cooking, playing with grandkids, smiling, bright warm lighting. | Vibrant, joyful, golden hour, high-contrast, triumphant, slow motion. |
| **The Product** | The physical solution. | The device spinning, being held, or actively working. | Product shot, macro photography, studio lighting, spinning mechanism. |

## III. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Step 1: The "Audio Audit" (Pacing Check)

Before visualization, read the script sentence aloud.

**The Rule:** If a sentence takes longer than 3 seconds to say, it must be fractured into multiple clips.

**Example:**
- **Script:** "Six weeks later, Robert remembered his granddaughter's name." (4 seconds).
- **Action:** Fracture into two units.

### Step 2: Fracture by Concept (Not Grammar)

Ignore commas and periods. Break the text where the mental image changes.

**Original Line:** "When Robert walked into his studio at 71, he couldn't remember his granddaughter's name."

- **Fracture A (Setting the Scene):** "When Robert walked into his studio at 71," → *Visual: Robert entering a door.*
- **Fracture B (The Pain):** "...he couldn't remember his granddaughter's name." → *Visual: Robert looking confused/blank.*

### Step 3: Assign Bucket & Prompt

For each fractured line, assign a "Bucket" (from Section II) and write the prompt using the formula below.

### Step 4: The "Boredom Test" (Quality Control)

Review the storyboard sequence:

1. **Is there a "Talking Head" gap?** Are there back-to-back clips of just a person looking at the camera? *Fix: Insert a B-roll or Mechanism shot between them.*

2. **Is the clip "Busy" enough?**
   - *Bad:* An old man sitting.
   - *Good:* An old man sitting nervously tapping his fingers while looking at a clock.

3. **Logical Flow:** Does the visual of Clip A naturally lead into the visual of Clip B?

## IV. The AI Prompting Formula

To generate usable clips at scale (Veo 3 / Runway / Kling), use this strict prompt structure:

```
[Style/Lens] + [Subject + Action] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Context/Detail]
```

- **Style:** Cinematic, hyper-realistic, 85mm lens, high-fidelity, macro shot, medical animation.
- **Subject + Action:** An elderly woman's hand trembling as she tries to grip a doorknob.
- **Lighting:** Cold blue morning light, dramatic shadows, volumetric lighting.
- **Context:** Sterile nursing home hallway background, dust particles in air.

## V. Advanced Strategies (The "New Meta")

### 1. The UMP (Unique Mechanism of the Problem)

Do not just show "Brain Health." Show the **mechanism**.

- **Generic:** A healthy brain.
- **UMP:** A chain reaction. Weak Hands → Dead Nerves → Dim Brain.

**Visual Strategy:** Use contrasting visuals (Dim/Bright, Dead/Alive) to show the mechanism working or failing.

### 2. Multi-Character Social Proof

Don't rely on a single narrator. Use AI Voice (11Labs) to create a cast.

- **Cast:** Narrator (Master Chen), The Victim (Robert), The Observer (Robert's Wife/Daughter).
- **Visuals:** Generate specific avatars for each voice. Have the avatars hold the product using AI video tools (HeyGen/Veo) to ground the story in reality.

### 3. "Slamming Concepts"

Facebook/YouTube algorithms now require high creative volume.

**Strategy:** Keep the Structure and Script the same, but swap the Concept Units.

**Test:**
- Swap the "Hero" (White Male vs. Black Female)
- Swap the "Authority" (Tai Chi Master vs. Retired Neurosurgeon)
- Swap the "UMP Visualization" (Wires vs. Roots)

### 4. Editing Rules

- **Cuts Only:** No fades, no dissolves, no wipes. Standard hard cuts.
- **Jump Cuts:** Only use sparingly to "shock" attention back during a boring segment.
- **Sound Design:** Every visual action needs a corresponding sound (e.g., a thud when the bottle drops, a hum when the nerves light up).
