You are a direct response video producer. Given a script. You are to use the following playbooks to break up a script into specific "boundaries" or "segments" where we can then suggest a clip for that segment
I will now provide the script

<SCRIPT> This tiny device makes any fridge completely odorless in 24 hours. And grocery chains are doing everything they can to keep it off the shelves. Here's why. Every fridge develops that smell. Bacteria and mold spores float through the air inside your fridge. They land on your food. They multiply. And they create that musty odor that hits you every time you open the door. Most people try baking soda or charcoal. But none of it works. They just absorb the odor and fill up in two weeks. They don't do anything about the actual cause of the odor. Meanwhile the bacteria keeps spreading. Your food keeps spoiling faster. And you keep throwing money in the trash. That's where this device comes in. A materials engineer named David Chen spent 18 years developing technology for food warehouses storing millions of dollars of food. His team developed a nano-catalytic technology that doesn't absorb odors... it destroys them. At the molecular level. For years, this technology was locked away in commercial facilities. Then one Thanksgiving, Chen visited his mother... She'd been cooking all day. The whole family was coming. She wanted everything perfect. When he opened her fridge... that smell hit him. She got embarrassed. She told him she'd tried everything. Baking soda. Charcoal. Nothing worked. She'd scrubbed the whole fridge the week before. The smell came right back. And Chen realized something. He'd spent two decades protecting million-dollar food warehouses.  But his own mother was fighting the same problem with a three-dollar box of baking soda. That night, he miniaturized the technology. Small enough for a home fridge. He gave the first one to his mother. Within 24 hours, the smell was gone. She called him crying, saying her fridge had never been this fresh. He called it FreshCore. Inside is a patented core packed with a special nano-catalytic material. Air circulates through 360 degrees of airflow, and the material breaks apart odor molecules, bacteria, and mold spores. It doesn't trap them. It destroys them. And because it's catalytic, it never depletes. Never saturates. It for ten years. You put it in and forget it exists. One woman had rotting meat leak under her fridge drawers.  She cleaned everything and he smell wouldn't leave. She put FreshCore in and the smell was gone in 24 hours. Helen bought one and her food started lasting twice as long. No more throwing away lettuce and berries every week. People are putting them in cars, closets, gym bags to keep them fresh and odorless. Now here's why it's hard to find. Chen tried to get FreshCore into stores. Every major retailer said no. He spent his savings on the first production run. When the stores rejected him, he almost gave up entirely. His mother told him to keep going. She said if it helped her, it would help other families too. So he started selling direct. Just him and a small team. No big warehouse. No massive inventory. Every batch sells out. And the next one takes weeks to manufacture because of the nano-catalytic core. Right now, there's still some left from the current run. But when it's gone, there's a wait. FreshCore costs less than what most families waste on spoiled food in one week.  And it works for a decade. If your fridge isn't fresher within 48 hours, send it back. Full refund. But most people don't send it back. They order more. FreshCore. Put it in. Forget it. Done. Click below before this batch is gone. </SCRIPT>
