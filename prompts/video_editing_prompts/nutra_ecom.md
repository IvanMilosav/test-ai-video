# The Direct Response "Neutra-Ecom" Creative Playbook

---

## I. Core Philosophy

**"We do not innovate on structure; we innovate within the structure."**

The script provides the narrative, but the Concept Unit provides the retention. In the current ad landscape (post-Andromeda), the battleground is purely visual. We must fight to hold the viewer's attention on a sentence-by-sentence basis.

**The Retention Rule:** If a viewer feels bored for a single sentence, they scroll.

**The Creative Meta:** First-mover advantage is superseded by superior creative. A better visual execution of the same script will steal the auction.

**The "Slop" Filter:** Every clip matters. Generic stock footage is "slop." We use AI to generate hyper-specific, narrative-driven visuals.

---

## II. The Ontology: Defining the Units

To break a script down effectively, stop reading sentences and start seeing Concept Units.

### 1. The Concept Unit (The Atom)

**Definition:** The smallest indivisible unit of visual storytelling.

**The Golden Rule:** One Concept Unit = One distinct visual idea.

**Constraint:** Never span a single clip across two distinct concepts (e.g., "The Problem" and "The Solution" must always be separate clips).

### 2. The Visual Taxonomy (The Buckets)

Every Concept Unit falls into one of these six buckets. Identify the bucket before writing the prompt.

| Bucket | Purpose | Visual Signature | AI Prompt Keywords |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **The Agitation** | Visually demonstrate the visceral struggle/pain. | Trembling, fumbling, dropping, dark lighting, frustration, isolation. | Hyper-realistic, close-up, struggle, trembling, cinematic gloom, clumsy. |
| **The UMP** | Explain the "Unique Mechanism of the Problem." | "Sciency" footage. Glowing nerves, dimming lights, disconnecting wires, biological animation. | Medical animation, high-fidelity, glowing neural pathways, sci-fi aesthetic, translucent skin. |
| **The Hero** | Relatability. The viewer sees themselves in the avatar. | Daily life, close-ups of faces, hands performing tasks, authentic home settings. | Cinematic, authentic, 60s/70s, relatable, candid, detailed texture. |
| **The Authority** | Establish trust and credibility. | "Master Chen," Doctors, White coats, Dojos, Stern/Wise expressions. | Wise, authoritative, serious, cinematic portrait, depth of field. |
| **The Paradise** | The "After" state. The emotional payoff. | Cooking, playing with grandkids, smiling, bright warm lighting. | Vibrant, joyful, golden hour, high-contrast, triumphant, slow motion. |
| **The Product** | The physical solution. | The device spinning, being held, or actively working. | Product shot, macro photography, studio lighting, spinning mechanism. |

## III. Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

### Step 1: Apply Fracture Rules

Ignore commas and periods. Break the text where the mental image changes. Use the following rules:

#### A) The Clause Fracture Rule

**Principle:** Break on grammatical clauses, not sentences.

Every independent clause = new segment. Every dependent clause introducing a new visual subject = new segment.

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Subject + Verb + Object = Often 2-3 segments
- "This [noun]" = Segment break (show the noun)
- "does/makes/creates [result]" = Segment break (show the result)
- Prepositional phrases with new locations = Segment break

**Example:**
> "This tiny device makes any fridge completely odorless in 24 hours."

| Fracture | Script | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "This tiny device" | Subject introduction — SHOW THE DEVICE |
| 2 | "makes any fridge completely odorless in 24 hours" | Result/benefit — SHOW THE RESULT |

#### B) The Noun Trigger Rule

**Principle:** Every new concrete noun demands a new clip.

When the script introduces a new tangible thing, the visual must change to show that thing.

**Trigger Words:**
- Physical objects: device, fridge, box, bag, food, shelf
- People: engineer, mother, woman, team
- Places: warehouse, store, kitchen, facility
- Concepts made physical: smell, bacteria, spores, odor

**Example:**
> "Most people try baking soda or charcoal."

| Fracture | Script | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "Most people try baking soda" | NOUN: baking soda — show it |
| 2 | "or charcoal" | NOUN: charcoal — show it |

#### C) The List Fracture Rule

**Principle:** Every item in any list = separate segment. No exceptions.

This applies to:
- Explicit lists: "X, Y, and Z"
- Implied lists: "X or Y"
- Consequence chains: "A keeps happening. B keeps happening."
- Location lists: "in cars, closets, gym bags"

**Example:**
> "People are putting them in cars, closets, gym bags to keep them fresh and odorless."

| Fracture | Script | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "People are putting them in cars," | Location 1: car |
| 2 | "closets," | Location 2: closet |
| 3 | "gym bags" | Location 3: gym bag |
| 4 | "to keep them fresh and odorless." | Benefit/result |

#### D) The Action-Reaction Fracture Rule

**Principle:** When script describes action → reaction, split them.

Action and reaction are two different visual moments.

**Pattern:**
- "When [action]... [reaction]"
- "[Someone did X]. [Result was Y]."
- "She [action]. He [response]."

**Example:**
> "When he opened her fridge... that smell hit him. She got embarrassed."

| Fracture | Script | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "When he opened her fridge" | ACTION: opening |
| 2 | "that smell hit him." | REACTION: his face |
| 3 | "She got embarrassed." | REACTION: her face |

#### E) The Fracture Decision Tree

Use this as a quick-reference for script analysis:

```
START: Read the line
│
├── Does it contain more than one concrete noun?
│   └── YES → FRACTURE on each noun
│
├── Does it contain a list (X, Y, Z or X and Y)?
│   └── YES → FRACTURE on each item
│
├── Does it describe action → reaction?
│   └── YES → FRACTURE into action segment + reaction segment
│
├── Does it contain a pivot word (but, however, then, that's where)?
│   └── YES → FRACTURE before the pivot word
│
├── Does the visual subject change mid-sentence?
│   └── YES → FRACTURE at the subject change
│
└── NO to all above → Keep as single segment
```

---

### Step 2: Assign Tags

Each segment should be tagged for clip sourcing and production.

#### Primary Tags (Clip Source)

| Tag | Definition | Clip Source |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `[PRODUCT]` | Device is primary subject | Product shoot / 3D render |
| `[HERO]` | Named character on screen | AI-generated / Actor footage |
| `[UGC]` | User-generated content style | Authentic / AI UGC |
| `[CGI]` | Animation or mechanism visualization | Motion graphics / AI animation |
| `[B-ROLL]` | Supplementary visualization | Stock / AI-generated |
| `[TEXT]` | Text card or overlay primary | Graphics package |
| `[TESTIMONIAL]` | Social proof moment | UGC / Actor footage |

#### Secondary Tags (Mood/Tone)

| Tag | Color Grade | Lighting |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| `[PROBLEM]` | Desaturated / Cool / B&W | Low-key, harsh |
| `[SOLUTION]` | Warm / Saturated | High-key, soft |
| `[AUTHORITY]` | Neutral / Clean | Professional, even |
| `[EMOTIONAL]` | Warm | Golden, natural |
| `[URGENCY]` | High contrast / Red accents | Dramatic |

---

### Step 3: Assign Bucket & Write Prompt

For each fractured segment, assign a "Bucket" (from Section II) and write the clip description using the AI Prompting Formula:

```
[Style/Lens] + [Subject + Action] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Context/Detail]
```

**Components:**
- **Style:** Cinematic, hyper-realistic, 85mm lens, high-fidelity, macro shot, medical animation.
- **Subject + Action:** An elderly woman's hand trembling as she tries to grip a doorknob.
- **Lighting:** Cold blue morning light, dramatic shadows, volumetric lighting.
- **Context:** Sterile nursing home hallway background, dust particles in air.

---

### Step 4: Use the Segment Output Template

Every segment should follow this standardized format:

```
### SEGMENT [NUMBER]
**Script:** *"[exact script text]"*
**Tags:** [PRIMARY] [SECONDARY]
**Bucket:** [From Section II taxonomy]
**Fracture Reason:** [Why this is its own segment]
**Clip Description:** [Detailed visual description using prompting formula]
```

---

### Step 5: The "Boredom Test" (Quality Control)

Review the storyboard sequence:

**Is there a "Talking Head" gap?** Are there back-to-back clips of just a person looking at the camera?
- Fix: Insert a B-roll or Mechanism shot between them.

**Is the clip "Busy" enough?**
- Bad: An old man sitting.
- Good: An old man sitting nervously tapping his fingers while looking at a clock.

**Logical Flow:** Does the visual of Clip A naturally lead into the visual of Clip B?

**Tag Consistency:** Do the secondary tags flow properly? (e.g., not jumping from `[PROBLEM]` to `[PARADISE]` without a `[SOLUTION]` transition)

---

## IV. The AI Prompting Formula

To generate usable clips at scale (Veo 3 / Runway / Kling), use this strict prompt structure:

```
[Style/Lens] + [Subject + Action] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Context/Detail]
```

**Style:** Cinematic, hyper-realistic, 85mm lens, high-fidelity, macro shot, medical animation.

**Subject + Action:** An elderly woman's hand trembling as she tries to grip a doorknob.

**Lighting:** Cold blue morning light, dramatic shadows, volumetric lighting.

**Context:** Sterile nursing home hallway background, dust particles in air.

---

## V. Advanced Strategies (The "New Meta")

### 1. The UMP (Unique Mechanism of the Problem)

Do not just show "Brain Health." Show the mechanism.

- **Generic:** A healthy brain.
- **UMP:** A chain reaction. Weak Hands → Dead Nerves → Dim Brain.

**Visual Strategy:** Use contrasting visuals (Dim/Bright, Dead/Alive) to show the mechanism working or failing.

### 2. Multi-Character Social Proof

Don't rely on a single narrator. Use AI Voice (11Labs) to create a cast.

**Cast:** Narrator (Master Chen), The Victim (Robert), The Observer (Robert's Wife/Daughter).

**Visuals:** Generate specific avatars for each voice. Have the avatars hold the product using AI video tools (HeyGen/Veo) to ground the story in reality.

### 3. "Slamming Concepts"

Facebook/YouTube algorithms now require high creative volume.

**Strategy:** Keep the Structure and Script the same, but swap the Concept Units.

**Test:** Swap the "Hero" (White Male vs. Black Female). Swap the "Authority" (Tai Chi Master vs. Retired Neurosurgeon). Swap the "UMP Visualization" (Wires vs. Roots).

### 4. Editing Rules

- **Cuts Only:** No fades, no dissolves, no wipes. Standard hard cuts.
- **Jump Cuts:** Only use sparingly to "shock" attention back during a boring segment.

## VI. Reference Tables

### A) Visual Verb Taxonomy

Use this to map script verbs to visual requirements:

| Script Verb Category | Visual Requirement | Example |
|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Showing verbs** (show, reveal, present) | Product/object enters frame | "This device" → hand holding device |
| **Result verbs** (makes, creates, destroys) | Show the result state | "makes odorless" → person smelling fresh fridge |
| **Attempt verbs** (try, use, test) | Show the action of attempting | "people try baking soda" → hand placing box |
| **Failure verbs** (doesn't work, fails, fills up) | Show failure state | "none of it works" → items in trash |
| **Continuation verbs** (keeps, continues, spreads) | Show progression/time-lapse | "bacteria keeps spreading" → colony growth |
| **Realization verbs** (realized, understood, saw) | Close-up on face, contemplative | "Chen realized" → his face thinking |
| **Emotional verbs** (embarrassed, cried, smiled) | Close-up on face showing emotion | "she got embarrassed" → her face |
| **Movement verbs** (visited, walked, opened) | Show the physical movement | "he opened her fridge" → hand on handle |
| **Communication verbs** (told, said, called) | Person speaking/on phone | "she called him crying" → on phone |
| **Transaction verbs** (bought, ordered, costs) | Money, cart, or product exchange | "Helen bought one" → her holding product |

### B) Transition Triggers

Use this to identify when the script demands a specific transition type:

| Script Language | Transition Type | Visual Instruction |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Here's why" / "Here's the thing" | Hard cut to narrator | Pause beat, then new visual context |
| "But" / "However" / "Yet" | Pivot cut | Shift from problem to solution visuals |
| "That's where/when" | Reveal cut | Product emerges, lighting shifts warm |
| "Then" / "One day" / "That night" | Time transition | New setting, possible time indicator |
| "Now" / "Right now" / "Today" | Present-tense anchor | Return to product or current state |
| "Meanwhile" | Parallel action cut | Show simultaneous consequence |
| "And" (in lists) | Quick cut | Same visual category, new subject |
| "Because" / "Since" | Mechanism cut | CGI or explanatory visual |

### C) Special Cases

#### Dialogue/Quote Handling

When script includes what someone "said" or "told":
- The saying verb = one segment (person speaking)
- The content of what was said = may need its own segment if it's a distinct concept

**Example:**
> "She said if it helped her, it would help other families too."

| Fracture | Script | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "She said if it helped her," | Her speaking + self-reference |
| 2 | "it would help other families too." | New subject: other families |

#### Temporal Phrases

Time references often need their own segment to establish the transition:
- "Within 24 hours" = show time passing
- "That night" = show nighttime setting
- "For years" = show duration indicator
- "One Thanksgiving" = show seasonal/holiday context

## VII. Character Bible Template

For scripts with narrative elements, define characters before segmentation:

| Character | Description | Visual Archetype | Segments Appearing | AI Prompt Keywords |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [Name] | Age, role, relationship to product | Bucket from Section II | List segment numbers | Style, features, clothing, expression |

**Example:**

| Character | Description | Visual Archetype | Segments Appearing | AI Prompt Keywords |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| David Chen | Materials engineer, 50s, Asian-American, inventor | The Authority | 22-23, 33, 37-38, 46-52, 87-91 | Cinematic portrait, Asian-American man, 50s, wire-rimmed glasses, button-down shirt, intelligent eyes, depth of field |
| Chen's Mother | Elderly Asian woman, 70s, dignified | The Hero | 34-45, 54-58, 92-93 | Elderly Asian woman, 70s, warm smile, kitchen setting, soft natural light, tender expression |
