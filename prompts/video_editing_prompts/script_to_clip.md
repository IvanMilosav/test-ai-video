# MASTER SCRIPT-TO-CLIP PLAYBOOK
## For Direct Response Video Advertising

---

This playbook provides cinematographic guidance for matching clips to script content. It is vertical-agnostic and based on patterns observed across multiple video advertisements.

## SECTION 1: SHOT TYPE TAXONOMY

This taxonomy defines the visual vocabulary used across all verticals. Every frame in a video ad must fall into one of these categories to serve a specific psychological function.

### A) PROTAGONIST/HERO SHOTS
Shots featuring a human narrator or character who acts as the anchor for trust and authority.

* **The Authority Anchor:** Medium shot, eye-level, direct address. Used to establish expertise or deliver the "truth."
  * *Example (MagVolt):* "22 years as a cell phone repair engineer" → Medium shot of man in home office.
  * *Example (NeuroSpin):* "Master Chen told her to watch" → Close-up of Master Chen's face.
* **The Relatable User:** Candid or "UGC-style" (User Generated Content). Used to bridge the gap between skepticism and belief.
  * *Example (MagAir Cowboy):* "I almost laughed in his face" → Medium shot of man leaning against a fence laughing.
* **The Action/Demonstration:** The protagonist engaging with the product physically.
  * *Example (CaneHero):* Narrator (implied protagonist) or actor unfolding the cane and walking.

### B) PRODUCT/SUBJECT SHOTS
Shots focused exclusively on the item being sold.

* **The "Artifact" Shot (Beauty Shot):** High-key lighting, clean background, often rotating or static. Establishes the product as a premium object.
  * *Example (CaneHero):* Black folding cane on white surface.
  * *Example (MagVolt):* Black charger block held in hand against neutral wall.
* **The Mechanism Shot:** Close-up or macro shot showing *how* it works (ports, buttons, lights).
  * *Example (MagAir):* Close-up of the device plugged in with the blue light glowing.
* **The Comparison Shot:** Split-screen or sequential shots showing Product A vs. Competitor B.
  * *Example (MagAir):* Split screen smoke chamber test (Product vs. Smoke).

### C) B-ROLL CATEGORIES
Supplementary footage used to visualize spoken concepts.

* **Visceral/Pain B-Roll:** High-contrast, often low-key or black & white footage depicting the problem.
  * *Example (CaneHero):* B&W footage of an elderly person falling on grass.
  * *Example (MagAir):* Close-up of black mold growing on a wall corner.
* **Metaphorical B-Roll:** Visuals that represent a concept rather than a literal reality.
  * *Example (CaneHero):* "Regulators will force" → Shot of a SWAT team (Visualizing force/government).
  * *Example (MagVolt):* "Waste of time" → Shot of a clock ticking.
* **Authority B-Roll:** Visuals that imply scale, industry, or science.
  * *Example (MagAir):* "NASA-powered" → Shot of NASA Vehicle Assembly Building.
  * *Example (MagVolt):* "Thousands of phones" → Overhead shot of a messy, professional repair workbench.

### D) TEXT/GRAPHIC SHOTS
Visuals where text or 2D graphics are the primary focus.

* **The Headline Card:** Large text on a solid or high-contrast background. Used for hooks.
  * *Example (MagAir):* "BAD NEWS" in red text on a white background.
* **The "Kill Switch" Overlay:** A red "X" or "Sold Out" graphic overlaid on a competitor product or setting.
  * *Example (MagVolt):* Red "X" over a phone settings menu.
* **The Scarcity Graphic:** Countdown timers, stock graphs, or "Sold Out" signs.
  * *Example (CaneHero):* Red line graph trending downwards ("Downgrade hits").

### E) SCREEN RECORDINGS/DEMOS (Simulation)
* **The Invisible Made Visible:** CGI or animation showing internal mechanisms or invisible forces (germs, electricity, nerves).
  * *Example (NeuroSpin):* Glowing yellow nerves running up a transparent arm.
  * *Example (MagVolt):* Battery icon filling up rapidly with a green animation.

## SECTION 2: CONCEPTUAL BOUNDARIES

A "Conceptual Boundary" is the exact moment a cut *must* occur. The data proves that holding a shot while the script introduces a new concept kills retention.

### A) SCRIPT-DRIVEN BOUNDARIES
Cut immediately when the script introduces a new noun, verb, or distinct concept.

* **The List Rule:** If the script lists items, cut on every item.
  * *Script:* "Headaches, stuffiness, and that mold taste..."
  * *Visuals:* Cut to headache shot → Cut to stuffy nose shot → Cut to woman looking ill.
* **The "But/However" Rule:** Always cut on the conjunction that signals a pivot.
  * *Script:* "But here's the bad news."
  * *Visual:* Cut from happy user to stark product shot.

### B) EMOTIONAL BOUNDARIES
Cut when the sentiment shifts from Positive to Negative (or vice versa).

* *Example (NeuroSpin):*
  * *Positive:* "Robert, the engineer who could fix anything" (Shot of him working competently).
  * *Negative:* "now, asked if he'd eaten breakfast..." (Shot of him looking confused at table).

## SECTION 3: PROTAGONIST/HERO USAGE PATTERNS

### A) WHEN TO SHOW THE PROTAGONIST
* **The Authority Hook:** Use the protagonist in the first 5 seconds if they represent a specific archetype (e.g., "22 years as a repair engineer").
* **The Vulnerable Confession:** Use a direct-address talking head when admitting a flaw or a past failure to build rapport.
  * *Example:* "I almost laughed in his face."
* **The "Trust Me" Close:** Return to the protagonist for the final recommendation before the hard CTA.

### B) WHEN TO CUT AWAY
* **Immediate Visualization:** As soon as the protagonist mentions a specific object, location, or problem, cut away to B-roll of that thing. Do not keep the camera on the speaker describing an object.
  * *Rule:* If they say "This chip," show the chip. If they say "My shop," show the shop.

## SECTION 4: SCRIPT-TO-CLIP MATCHING RULES

Use this reference table to select footage based on specific script triggers.

| SCRIPT CONTENT CATEGORY | VISUAL SELECTION RULE | DATA EXAMPLE |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scarcity / "Gone Forever"** | **Empty Spaces / Industrial Scale.** Show empty shelves, warehouses, or "Sold Out" signs. | Script: "Once this batch is gone..." → Visual: Vast empty warehouse aisle. |
| **"Government" / "Regulators"** | **Force / Bureaucracy.** Use SWAT teams, gavels, courthouses, or men in suits. | Script: "Regulators will force..." → Visual: SWAT team on truck / Lawyer arguing. |
| **Physical Pain / Medical** | **X-Rays / Anatomy / B&W Struggle.** Use medical imaging or black & white shots of people wincing/falling. | Script: "No broken hips..." → Visual: Doctor pointing at spinal X-ray. |
| **"Hidden" / "Invisible"** | **CGI / Microscope.** Use animation to make the invisible visible (germs, electricity, signals). | Script: "It sends a signal..." → Visual: Glowing red/blue lines entering phone. |
| **Competition / "Old Way"** | **Trash / Chaos / Red X.** Show the competitor product being thrown away, broken, or overlaid with a Red X. | Script: "Trash aluminum canes..." → Visual: Pile of black canes with Red X. |
| **Scientific Mechanism** | **Split Screen / Lab Test.** Show side-by-side comparison or a "lab setting" demonstration. | Script: "Destroys mold..." → Visual: Split screen smoke chamber test. |
| **High Value / "Expensive"** | **Counting Money.** Show hands counting cash or a high price tag. | Script: "Cost thousands..." → Visual: Hands counting stack of bills. |
| **"Easy" / "Simple"** | **Plug & Play.** Show the action of plugging in, unfolding, or turning on. One step. | Script: "Just plug it in..." → Visual: Hand plugging device into wall. |
| **"Military Grade" / "NASA"** | **Origin Context.** Show soldiers, space stations, or tactical environments. | Script: "Forged for wounded warriors..." → Visual: Soldier hiking in rough terrain. |

## SECTION 5: TRANSITION PATTERNS

### A) THE "PIVOT" SEQUENCE (The Golden Sequence)
This is the most common and effective sequence observed in the data.
1. **Agitation (B&W/Dark):** Visceral shot of the problem (Falling, Mold, Dead Battery).
2. **The Pivot (Audio):** "But then I found..." / "There is a new way..."
3. **The Reveal (Color/Bright):** High-key shot of the product in a pristine environment.
4. **The Payoff (Lifestyle):** The user happy/succeeding (Walking, Sleeping, fast phone).

### B) THE "AUTHORITY BRIDGE"
Used to validate a claim.
1. **Claim:** "It works 4x faster."
2. **Proof Visual:** Microscope shot / Lab timer / Circuit board close-up.
3. **Validation:** Authority figure nodding or working.

### C) AWKWARD TRANSITIONS TO AVOID
* **Static to Static:** Do not cut from a static talking head to another static talking head of the same angle. Change the angle (jump cut) or insert B-roll.
* **Literal to Literal:** Avoid cutting from a literal description of a feature to another literal description without an emotional or benefit-driven shot in between.

## SECTION 6: VERTICAL-AGNOSTIC PRINCIPLES

1. **Visual Hyperbole is Mandatory:** If the script says "regulators," show a SWAT team. If the script says "killing your phone," show a soldering iron smoking. Do not be subtle. Visuals must be exaggerated to match the emotional intensity of the copy.

2. **Color Coding:**
   * **Problem =** Desaturated, Cool, Dark, or Black & White.
   * **Solution =** Vibrant, Warm, High-Key, Saturated.
   * **Scarcity =** Red, High Contrast, Industrial.

3. **The "Mechanism" Must Be Visualized:** Never describe a technical process (ions, stability, smart chip) without a CGI animation or a diagram. If the viewer cannot *see* how it works, they will not believe it works.

4. **Pacing is Manipulation:**
   * **Fear/Agitation:** Fast cuts. Creates anxiety.
   * **Solution/Relief:** Slower cuts. Creates a sense of calm and stability.
